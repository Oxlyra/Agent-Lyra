How Does It Work?
Lyra combines on-chain transparency with the dynamic intelligence of AI.
	•	Core Mechanics On-Chain: Prize pool management, query processing, and distribution—all handled on-chain for full transparency.
	•	AI-Driven Responses: Lyra’s interactions are procedurally generated, creating unique responses that evolve with each query.
